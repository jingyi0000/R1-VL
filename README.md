## Abstract
Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are.
In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMsâ€™ reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. 
To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding.
Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards:
Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR).
StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy.
With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning.

## Evaluation
We use [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) to evaluate our models on different benchmarks. Here, we provide the evaluation instructions.

First, install VLMEvalKit according to the [official instructions](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit/blob/main/docs/en/Quickstart.md).

Then, replace the necessary files with those in [this folder](https://github.com/jingyi0000/R1-VL/tree/main/eval).

Finally, perform evaluation via following command:
```bash
python run.py --data MathVista_MINI --model R1-VL-7B --verbose
```
For more evaluation options, please refer to [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit).

## Training

### SFT warm-up

#### Data Preparation
Download [Mulberry-260K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuanjinYao/Mulberry-SFT) and remove the reflective reasoning data.
#### Training
We use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) to perform SFT warm-up:

First, install LLaMA-Factory according to the [official_instruction](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

Then, refer to [here](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/data/README.md) and update the following customized dataset into `dataset_info.json` in LLaMA-Factory.

```bash
"r1_vl_sft": {
    "file_name": "./mulberry_sft_wo_reflective_data.json",
    "formatting": "sharegpt",
    "columns": {
      "messages": "messages",
      "images": "images"
    },
    "tags": {
      "role_tag": "role",
      "content_tag": "content",
      "user_tag": "user",
      "assistant_tag": "assistant"
    }
  },
```

Finally, use the following command to train the models.
```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_full/qwen2vl_2b_full_sft.yaml
```
Please refer to [this folder](https://github.com/jingyi0000/R1-VL/tree/main/sft) for the training parameters used in the SFT warm-up stage.

### RL with StepGRPO
Coming soon!


## Main results
We conduct experiments with two powerful baseline models, including [Qwen2-VL-2B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) and [Qwen2-VL-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct). The **Main Results** comparing the R1-VL models with other state-of-the-art models across several widely-adopted benchmarks are shown in the figure below. All the experiments are conducted on 4 H100-80GB GPUs.
